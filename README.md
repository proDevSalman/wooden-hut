<b>stallion-stud-farm is the project that is built to show the skills and taste of my work to the employers.
So, the changes or distribution of code is not appreciated and I want you to do avoid such activities with the code because I want to show my work to employer not anyone else's contribution.
But you can still see the code and learn from it.</b>
